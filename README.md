Known bugs and TodoTh : 

~~1. Workflow tracker doesnt export the total hours for the week.~~
~~2. Add Neo scheduled date to the database.~~
~~3. Add License stuff to table, then delete when we process candidate.~~
~~4. Candidate flyout doesnt have a scroll bar; so the stuff lower down gets blocked by the screen.~~
~~5. No license fields in the pii section.~~
~~6. Bank Account number demands a 20 character input. ~~
~~7. License info in the PII screen extends past the width of the modal.~~
~~8. Increase usable space in the database page. Add QOL features. ~~
~~9. Social is required when no social is entered. ~~
~~10. Social and license info arent saving into the database. ~~
~~11. Social and license info arent persisting for some reason.~~
~~12. Wipe the license and other sensitive info when we process the candidate. ~~
~~13. Check the weekly tracker output.~~

Added:
1. Pill to weekly tracker, that calculates hours after you save the week. This requires reopening the weekly tracker. I might change that to stay open. 
2. Ability to search the database for entries.
